# Bethel Energy Efficiency Plan

A data-driven municipal energy strategy for the Town of Bethel, Maine, developed as part of the **ECO505: Sustainable Energy Economics & Policy** course at the **University of Maine** (Spring 2025). This graduate-level service-learning project analyzes current energy use across six municipal facilities and proposes a cost-effective, sustainable 5-year roadmap for energy efficiency and renewable energy adoption.

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project was conducted in collaboration with the **Town of Bethel** and the **Bethel Conservation Commission** under the mentorship of **Dr. Sharon Klein**, Associate Professor, School of Economics, University of Maine.

The objective was to:
- Assess municipal energy consumption and cost drivers.
- Apply economic evaluation tools to compare traditional vs. renewable energy scenarios.
- Propose actionable strategies to support Bethel’s clean energy goals and CRP commitments.

## 🔍 Key Components

- **Facility Energy Use Assessment**: Data from a 2024 energy audit was analyzed across six municipal buildings (Town Office, Fire Station, Town Garage, Airport Terminal, Ambulance Barn, Wastewater Treatment Plant).
  
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**: Applied metrics including:
  - Net Present Value (NPV)
  - Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)
  - Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
  - Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)
  - Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Monetization

- **Scenario Modeling**: Developed 5-year and 25-year financial models comparing status quo energy costs with solar PV adoption and energy efficiency upgrades.

- **Recommendations**: Phased solar installation, energy audits, real-time tracking systems, weatherization strategies, and alignment with state and federal clean energy incentives.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- Microsoft Excel (for Gantt charts and financial modeling)
- Public datasets (U.S. DOE, EPA, Maine GOPIF)
- Peer-reviewed valuation frameworks for energy economics
